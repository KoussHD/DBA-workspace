1> SQLCMD -L  OR OSQL -L

There are configuration options you can set to prevent a SQL Server from showing in the list. To do this...  C:\> svrnetcn (In the enabled protocols list, select 'TCP/IP', then click properties. There is a check box for 'Hide server'.)
 
1- allow a user with only the public role to view all users in the master.dbo.syslogin view?
You have two options:

1. GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION (not recommended)

2. GRANT VIEW DEFINITION ON LOGIN::User1 TO User2

User1 will be the user you want to view the metadata of and User2 is the user who should have access to view the data.

C. Using command prompt environment variables within sqlcmd
------------------------------------------------------------    
In the following example, four environment variables are set and then called from sqlcmd.
C:\>SET tablename=Person.Person
C:\>SET col1=FirstName
C:\>SET col2=LastName
C:\>SET title=Ms.
C:\>sqlcmd -S mcr-ora-t05\MTLDB -d AdventureWorks2012 -l 60
1> SELECT TOP 5 $(col1) + ' ' + $(col2) AS Name
2> FROM $(tablename)
3> WHERE Title ='$(title)'
4> GO
--------------------------------------------------------
D Using user-level environment variables within sqlcmd
-------------------------------------------------------
I the following example the user-level environmental variable %Temp% is set at the command prompt and passed to the sqlcmd input file. To obtain the user-level windows environment variable.
 
iput file c:\testscript.txt:
:UT $(MyTempDirectory)
USE AdventureWorks2012;
SELECT FirstName
FROM AdventureWorks2012.Person.Person
WHERE BusinessEntityID < 5;
 
command prompt:
C\ >SET MyTempDirectory=%Temp%\output.txt
C:\ >sqlcmd -i C:\testscript.txt
following result is sent to output file C:\Documents and Settings\<user>\Local Settings\Temp\output.txt.
 
Canged database context to 'AdventureWorks2012'.
FirstName
--------------------------------------------------
Gstavo
Catherine
Kim
Hmberto
 
----------------------------------------------------------
E Using a startup script
-----------------------------------------------------------
A sqlcmd startup script is executed when sqlcmd is started. 
following example sets the environment variable SQLCMDINI. 
- The Contents of init.sql.
SET NOCOUNT ON
GO
DECLARE @nt_username nvarchar(128)
SET @nt_username = (SELECT rtrim(convert(nvarchar(128), nt_username)) FROM sys.dm_exec_sessions WHERE sessions_id= @@SPID)
SELECT @nt_username + ' is connected to ' +rtrim(CONVERT(nvarchar(20), SERVERPROPERTY('servername'))) +' (' +rtrim(CONVERT(nvarchar(20), SERVERPROPERTY('productversion'))) +')'
:setvar SQLCMDMAXFIXEDTYPEWIDTH 100
SET NOCOUNT OFF
GO
:setvar SQLCMDMAXFIXEDTYPEWIDTH

This calls the init.sql file when sqlcmd is started.
C:\> SET sqlcmdini=c:\init.sql
>1 Sqlcmd



This is the output.
>1 < user > is connected to < server > (9.00.2047.00)  



sp_MSforeachtable - allows you to process some code against each and every table in a single database.Its present in the master database. 
This is used to process a single command or multiple commands against tables in sinlge database.

Below is the syntax for calling the sp_MSforeachtable Stored procedure:
exec @RETURN_VALUE=sp_MSforeachtable @command1, @replacechar, @command2, @command3, @whereand, @precommand, @postcommand
Where:
@RETURN_VALUE - the return value which will be set by "sp_MSforeachtable"
@command1 - first command to be executed by "sp_MSforeachtable" and is defined as a nvarchar(2000)
@replacechar - character in the command string that will be replaced with the table name being processed (default replacechar is a "?")
@command2 and @command3 are two additional commands that can be run for each table, where @command2 runs after @command1, and @command3 will be run after @command2
@whereand - can be used to add additional constraints to help identify the rows in the sysobjects table that will be selected, this parameter is also a nvarchar(2000)
@precommand - nvarchar(2000) parameter and specifies a command to be run prior to processing any table
@postcommand - nvarchar(2000) field used to identify a command to be run after all commands have been processed against all tables 
  EXAMPLES: 
                                                                                                                                
EXEC sp_MSforeachdb @command1='use ?; exec sp_changedbowner ''sa''' -- Change all DBs to "sa" owner

EXEC sp_MSforeachdb @command1='ALTER DATABASE ? SET PAGE_VERIFY CHECKSUM' -- SQL 2005 Best Practice

EXEC sp_MSforeachdb @command1='?.dbo.sp_change_users_login ''Report''' -- Check for Orphans
