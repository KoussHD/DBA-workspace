A SQL Management Object Mismatch means that either a SQL plan baseline, or a SQL profile, or a SQL patch has been created for your SQL statement between the executions. Because a cursor is a read-only entity, a hard parse is forced to be able to create a new cursor that contains information about the new SQL management object related to this SQL statement.

H HASH_MATCH_FAILED		No existing child cursors have the unsafe literal bind hash values required by the current cursor
P PURGED_CURSOR		        Child cursor is marked for purging
B BIND_LENGTH_UPGRADEABLE	Bind length(s) required for the current cursor are longer than the bind length(s) used to build the child cursor
U USE_FEEDBACK_STATS		A hard parse is forced so that the optimizer can reoptimize the query with improved cardinality estimates
R REASON                  	Child number, id, and reason the cursor is not shared. The content of this column is structured using XML.
