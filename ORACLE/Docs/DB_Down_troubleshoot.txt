When the environmentvariable  “ORACLE_SID=” is set to the desired DB the instance seems to read the spfile from the default-location 
($ORACLE_HOME/dbs) in the default-filenameformat (spfileSID.ora)
– no matter if the DB is up or not. So one can connect to an idle instance and create a PFILE:

sqlplus '/ as sysdba';

Connected to an idle instance.
SQL> create pfile from spfile;
File created.
OR
sqlplus /nolog
