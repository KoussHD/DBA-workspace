System Stats:
A- Gathering noworkload stats builtin with Oracle 
EXEC DBMS_STATS.gather_system_stats;
B- Workload: When initiated using the start/stop or interval parameters .accurate idea of the performance of the system. If workload statistics are present, they will be used in preference to noworkload statistics.

Collect System Statistics for OLTP:
-- Manually start and stop to sample a representative time (several hours) of system activity.
EXEC DBMS_STATS.gather_system_stats('start');
EXEC DBMS_STATS.gather_system_stats('stop');

-- Sample from now until a specific number of minutes.
exec DBMS_STATS.gather_system_stats('interval', interval => 120);  --minutes 

Transfering Stats:
====================                                                                           
It is possible to transfer statistics between servers allowing consistent execution plans between servers with varying amounts of data. 
First 1. Create a table for OLTP statistics:
SQL> execute DBMS_STATS.CREATE_STAT_TABLE ('SYS','OLTP_stats','USERS');    ---table,tablespace remove to make it user's default
Second 2. The statistics must be collected into a statistics table. 
exec DBMS_STATS.GATHER_SYSTEM_STATS(gathering_mode => 'INTERVAL', interval => 180, stattab => 'OLTP_stats', statid => 'OLTP');
3. Transfer the OLTP statistics from OLTP_STATS table to the dictionary tables:
SQL> execute DBMS_STATS.IMPORT_SYSTEM_STATS(stattab => 'OLTP_stats', statid => 'OLTP', statown => 'SYS');

The most important thing is that the ratio between single block read and multiblock read is ok, because the choice between full scan and index access is based on that.
Defaults are usually ok. They cost single block reads to 12 milliseconds and multi-block reads to 26, which is probably fine.
If you have a storage with very low latency but same bandwidth (SSD for example) then accurate system statistics may be better and favor index access over full table scans because this storage is optimal for that.

***      *** STATSPACK ***
============================================================

This is an Oracle performance diagnosis tool, and I highly recommend that Unix administrators learn to use this tool. There are really two types of collection options: level and threshold. 
You need to configure the level parameter, which controls the type of data collected from Oracle. The threshold parameter acts as a filter for the collection of SQL statements the status 
summary tables.
Here's how to install it. After logging on to the systems as Oracle, start up sqlplus and then just follow the steps as instructed (see Listing 9).
SQL> CREATE TABLESPACE PERFSTAT DATAFILE 'E:\ORACLE\ORADATA\PRD1\perfstat.dbf' SIZE 500M AUTOEXTEND OFF;  ---  /ora_data/prd1/perfstat.dbf
SQL>  CONNECT / AS SYSDBA
SQL>  define default_tablespace='PERFSTAT'
SQL>  define temporary_tablespace='TEMP'
SQL>  define perfstat_password='Perf$dba'
SQL>  @?/rdbms/admin/spcreate
To ensure that no errors were encountered during the installation, check the SPCUSR.LIS, SPCTAB.LIS, and SPCPKG.LIS output files. For example:

ORACLE_HOME/bin/spcusr.lis
ORACLE_HOME/bin/spctab.lis
ORACLE_HOME/bin/spcpkg.lis

1- Using Statspack:
====================

The following topics are discussed in this section:
SQL>  CONNECT perfstat/my_perfstat_password
SQL> variable snap number;
SQL> begin   :snap := statspack.snap;   end;
 /
SQL> print snap
      SNAP
----------
        12
2- Using DBMS_SCHEDULER to Collect Statistics
========================================

The DBMS_JOB package is an Oracle-automated method for scheduling and running different tasks, such as collecting statistics. A sample script on how to do this is supplied in SPAUTO.SQL
10g >+
SQL> sqlplus / as sysdba
grant create job to perfstat;

sqlplus /nolog
connect perfstat/pw;
BEGIN
DBMS_SCHEDULER.CREATE_JOB (
job_name => 'PERFSTAT.sp_snapshot',
job_type => 'STORED_PROCEDURE',
job_action => 'statspack.snap',
repeat_interval => 'freq=daily;byday=mon,tue,wed,thu,fri;BYHOUR=8,9,10,11,13,14; BYMINUTE=1',
auto_drop => FALSE,
enabled => TRUE,
comments => 'Statspack automated snap');
END;
/

BEGIN
DBMS_SCHEDULER.SET_ATTRIBUTE (
   name           =>   'PERFSTAT.sp_snapshot',
   attribute      =>   'repeat_interval',
   value          =>   'freq=daily;byday=mon,tue,wed,thu,fri;BYHOUR=8,9,10,11,13,14,15,16,17; BYMINUTE=0');
END;

3- Running a Statspack Performance Report :
Once snapshots are taken, there are two reports available - an Instance report (spreport.sql) , and a SQL report (sprepsql.sql and sprsqins.sql):


 BEGIN_SNAP : specifies the begin snapshot ID
 END_SNAP   : specifies the end snapshot ID
 HASH_VALUE : specifies the hash value of a SQL query
 REPORT_NAME: specifies the report output name

DB File Scattered Read  Wait for Multi-block read of a table or index (full scan): tune the code and/or cache small tables.
DB File Sequential Read Wait for single block read of a table or index. Indicates many index reads: tune the code (especially joins).
DB File parallel read	Used when Oracle performs in parallel reads from multiple datafiles to non-contiguous buffers in memory (PGA or Buffer Cache). Similar to db file sequential read
Free Buffer             Increase the DB_CACHE_SIZE; shorten the checkpoint; tune the code.
Buffer Busy             Segment header: add freelists or freelist groups.
Buffer Busy             Data block: separate "hot" data; use reverse key indexes and/or smaller blocks.
Buffer Busy             Data block: increase initrans and/or maxtrans.
Buffer Busy             Undo header: add rollback segments or areas.
Buffer Busy             Undo block: commit more often; use larger rollback segments or areas.
Latch Free              Investigate the latch detail.
Enqueue-ST              Use LMTs or preallocate large extents.
Enqueue-HW              Preallocate extents above high-water mark.
Enqueue-TX4             Increase initrans and/or maxtrans on the table or index.
Enqueue-TM              Index foreign keys; check application locking of tables.
Log Buffer Space        Increase the log buffer; use faster disks for the redo logs.
Log File Switch         Archive destination slow or full; add more or larger redo logs.
Log File Sync           Commit more records at a time; use faster redo log disks or raw devices.
Direct Path Read	Used by Oracle when reading directly into PGA (sort or hash)
Direct Path Write	Used by Oracle when writing directly into PGA (sort or hash)
Idle Event              Ignore it.
==== WAITS
Common I/O related waits:-
        Db file sequential read  Index reads or scans
        Db file scattered read  Full table scans
        Direct path read/write  Temp IO
        Log related waits	- IO, switches, buffer
-- non_idle_wait_time = DB Time - DB CPU
Wait Events  Where to Jump?
Db file * read           ->SQL by buffer gets/disk reads, File IO stats
CPU Time                 -> Parse rates, Sorts, SQL executions, SQL buffer gets/disk reads, SMP processes(bugs)
Direct path reads/writes -> Sorts, Hash joins, hash/sort_area_size, File IO Stats
Buffer busy waits        -> Buffer pool, Buffer waits, File IO stats,  Segment statistics
Other important wait events (e.g. latches, enqueues) have corresponding statspack sections to themselves

=========
1. DB File Scattered Read: 
That generally happens during many full scan of a table or Fast Full Index Scans. As full table scans are pulled into memory, they rarely fall into contiguous buffers but instead are scattered throughout the buffer cache. A large number here indicates that your table may have missing indexes or your indexes are not used. Although it may be more efficient in your situation to perform a full table scan than an index scan, check to ensure that full table scans are necessary when you see these waits. Try to cache small tables to avoid reading them in over and over again, since a full table scan is put at the cold end of the LRU (Least Recently Used) list. You can use the Statspack report to help identify the query in question and fix it.
The init.ora parameter db_file_multiblock_read_count specifies the maximum numbers of blocks read in that way. Typically, this parameter should have values of 4-16 independent of the size of the database but with higher values needed with smaller Oracle block sizes. If you have a high wait time for this event, you either need to reduce the cost of I/O, e.g. by getting faster disks or by distributing your I/O load better, or you need to reduce the amount of full table scans by tuning SQL statements. The appearance of thedb file scattered read and db file sequential readevents may not necessarily indicate a problem, as IO is a normal activity on a healthy instance. However, they can indicate problems if any of the following circumstances are true:
 The data-access method is bad (that is, the SQL statements are poorly tuned), resulting in unnecessary or inefficient IO operations
 The IO system is overloaded and performing poorly
 The IO system is under-configured for the load
 IO operations are taking too long

If this Wait Event is a significant portion of Wait Time then a number of approaches are possible:
o Find which SQL statements perform Full Table or Fast Full Index scans and tune them to make sure these scans are necessary and not the result of a suboptimal plan.
- Starting with Oracle9i the new view V$SQL_PLAN view can help:
For Full Table scans:
select sql_text from v$sqltext t, v$sql_plan p
  where t.hash_value=p.hash_value 
    and p.operation='TABLE ACCESS'
    and p.options='FULL'
  order by p.hash_value, t.piece;

For Fast Full Index scans:
select sql_text from v$sqltext t, v$sql_plan p
  where t.hash_value=p.hash_value 
    and p.operation='INDEX'
    and p.options='FULL SCAN'
  order by p.hash_value, t.piece;

o In cases where such multiblock scans occur from optimal execution plans it is possible to tune the size of multiblock I/Os issued by Oracle by setting the instance parameter DB_FILE_MULTIBLOCK_READ_COUNT so that:
DB_BLOCK_SIZE x DB_FILE_MULTIBLOCK_READ_COUNT = max_io_size of system 
Query tuning should be used to optimize online SQL to use indexes.

2. DB File Sequential Read: 
 This could indicate poor joining orders in your SQL or waiting for writes to TEMP space generally (direct loads, Parallel DML (PDML) such as parallel updates. It could mean that a lot of index reads/scans are going on. Depending on the problem it may help to tune PGA_AGGREGATE_TARGET and/or DB_CACHE_SIZE. 
 The sequential read event identifies Oracle reading blocks sequentially, i.e. one after each other.. A large number of waits here could indicate poor joining orders of tables, unselective indexing or you either need to reduce the cost of I/O, e.g. by getting faster disks or by distributing your I/O load better,
 or you need to reduce the amount of I/O by increasing the buffer cache or by tuning SQL statements. It is normal for this number to be large for a high-transaction, well-tuned system, but it can indicate problems in some circumstances. You should correlate this wait statistic with other known issues within the Statspack report, such as inefficient SQL.
 Check to "ensure that index scans are necessary", and check "join orders" for multiple table joins. The "DB_CACHE_SIZE" will also be a determining factor in how often these waits show up. Problematic hash-area joins should show up in the PGA memory, but they're also memory hogs that could cause high wait numbers for sequential reads.
 They can also show up as direct path read/write waits. These circumstances are usually interrelated. When they occur in conjunction with the appearance of the 'db file scattered read' and 'db file sequential read' in the Top 5 Wait Events section, first you should examine the SQL Ordered by Physical Reads section of the report, 
 to see if it might be helpful to tune the statements with the highest resource usage. It could be because the indexes are fragmented. in this case, rebuilding the index will compact it and will produce to visit less blocks.
 Then, to determine whether there is a potential I/O bottleneck, examine the OS I/O statistics for corresponding symptoms. Also look at the average time per read in the Tablespace and File I/O sections of the report. 
 If many I/O-related events appear high in the Wait Events list, re-examine the host hardware for disk bottlenecks and check the host-hardware statistics for indications that a disk reconfiguration may be of benefit.
 Block reads are fairly inevitable so the aim should be to minimize unnecessary I/O. I/O for sequential reads can be reduced by tuning SQL calls that result in full table scans and using the partitioning option for large tables.

3. Free Buffer Waits: When a session needs a free buffer and cannot find one, it will post the database writer process asking it to flush dirty blocks. Waits in this category may indicate that you need to increase the DB_BUFFER_CACHE, if all your SQL is tuned. Free buffer waits could also indicate that unselective SQL is causing data to flood the buffer cache with index blocks, leaving none for this particular statement that is waiting for the system to process. 
This normally indicates that there is a substantial amount of DML (insert/update/delete) being done and that the Database Writer (DBWR) is not writing quickly enough; the buffer cache could be full of multiple versions of the same buffer, causing great inefficiency. To address this, you may want to consider accelerating incremental checkpointing, using more DBWR processes, or increasing the number of physical disks. To investigate if this is an I/O problem,
look at the statspack file I/O Statistics. Increase the DB_CACHE_SIZE; shorten the checkpoint; tune the code to get less dirty blocks, faster I/O, use multiple DBWRs. 

4. Buffer Busy Waits. A buffer busy wait happens when multiple processes concurrently want to modify the same block in the buffer cache. This typically happens during massive parallel inserts if your tables do not have free lists and it can happen if you have too few rollback segments. Buffer busy waits should not be greater than 1 percent. Check the Buffer Wait Statistics section (or V$WAITSTAT) to find out if the wait is on a segment header. 
If this is the case, increase the freelist groups or increase the pctused to pctfree gap. If the wait is on an undo header, you can address this by adding rollback segments; if it's on an undo block, you need to reduce the data density on the table driving this consistent read or increase the DB_CACHE_SIZE. If the wait is on a data block, you can move data to another block to avoid this hot block, increase the freelists on the table, or use Locally Managed Tablespaces (LMTs). 
If it's on an index block, you should rebuild the index, partition the index, or use a reverse key index. To prevent buffer busy waits related to data blocks, you can also use a smaller block size: fewer records fall within a single block in this case, so it's not as "hot." When a DML (insert/update/ delete) occurs, Oracle Database writes information into the block, including all users who are "interested" in the state of the block (Interested Transaction List, ITL). 
To decrease waits in this area, you can increase the initrans, which will create the space in the block to allow multiple ITL slots. You can also increase the pctfree on the table where this block exists (this writes the ITL information up to the number specified by maxtrans, when there are not enough slots built with the initrans that is specified). Buffer busy waits can be reduced by using reverse-key indexes for busy indexes and by partitioning busy tables.
Buffer Busy Wait on Segment Header  Add freelists (if inserts) or freelist groups (esp. RAC). Use ASSM.
Buffer Busy Wait on Data Block  Separate hot data; potentially use reverse key indexes; fix queries to reduce the blocks popularity, use smaller blocks, I/O, Increase initrans and/or maxtrans (this ones debatable). Reduce records per block

5. Latch Free. Latches are low-level queuing mechanisms (they're accurately referred to as mutual exclusion mechanisms) used to protect shared memory structures in the system global area (SGA). Latches are like locks on memory that are very quickly obtained and released. Latches are used to prevent concurrent access to a shared memory structure. If the latch is not available, a latch free miss is recorded. Most latch problems are related to the failure to use bind variables (library cache latch), 
  redo generation issues (redo allocation latch), buffer cache contention issues (cache buffers LRU chain), and hot blocks in the buffer cache (cache buffers chain). There are also latch waits related to bugs; check MetaLink for bug reports if you suspect this is the case. When latch miss ratios are greater than 0.5 percent, you should investigate the issue. If latch free waits are in the Top 5 Wait Events or high in the complete Wait Events list, look at the latch-specific sections of the Statspack report to see which latches are contended for.
6. Enqueue. An enqueue is a lock that protects a shared resource. Locks protect shared resources, such as data in a record, to prevent two people from updating the same data at the same time application, e.g. when a select for update is executed.. An enqueue includes a queuing mechanism, which is FIFO (first in, first out). Note that Oracle's latching mechanism is not FIFO. Enqueue waits usually point to the ST enqueue, the HW enqueue, the TX4 enqueue, and the TM enqueue. 
   The ST enqueue is used for space management and allocation for dictionary-managed tablespaces. Use LMTs, or try to preallocate extents or at least make the next extent larger for problematic dictionary-managed tablespaces. HW enqueues are used with the high-water mark of a segment; manually allocating the extents can circumvent this wait. TX4s are the most common enqueue waits. TX4 enqueue waits are usually the result of one of three issues. The first issue is duplicates in a unique index; you need to commit/rollback to free the enqueue. 
   The second is multiple updates to the same bitmap index fragment. Since a single bitmap fragment may contain multiple rowids, you need to issue a commit or rollback to free the enqueue when multiple users are trying to update the same fragment. The third and most likely issue is when multiple users are updating the same block. If there are no free ITL slots, a block-level lock could occur. You can easily avoid this scenario by increasing the initrans and/or maxtrans to allow multiple ITL slots and/or by increasing the pctfree on the table. 
   Finally, TM enqueues occur during DML to prevent DDL to the affected object. If you have foreign keys, be sure to index them to avoid this general locking issue.
Enqueue - ST Use LMTs or pre-allocate large extents 
Enqueue - HW Pre-allocate extents above HW (high water mark.)
Enqueue  TX Increase initrans and/or maxtrans (TX4) on (transaction) the table or index.  Fix locking issues if TX6.  Bitmap (TX4) & Duplicates in Index (TX4).
Enqueue - TM Index foreign keys; Check application (trans. mgmt.) locking of tables.  DML Locks.

7. Log Buffer Space
   This wait occurs because you are writing the log buffer faster than LGWR can write it to the redo logs, or because log switches are too slow. To address this problem, increase the size of the redo log files, or increase the size of the log buffer, or get faster disks to write to. You might even consider using solid-state disks, for their high speed.

8. Log File Switch
   All commit requests are waiting for "logfile switch (archiving needed)" or "logfile switch (chkpt. Incomplete)." Ensure that the archive disk is not full or slow. DBWR may be too slow because of I/O. You may need to add more or larger redo logs, and you may potentially need to add database writers if the DBWR is the problem.

9. Log File Sync
  A Log File Sync happens each time a commit (or rollback) takes place. If there are a lot of waits in this area then you may want to examine your application to see if you are committing too frequently (or at least more than you need to). When a user commits or rolls back data, the LGWR flushes the session's redo from the log buffer to the redo logs. The log file sync process must wait for this to successfully complete. 
  To reduce wait events here, try to commit more records (try to commit a batch of 50 instead of one at a time, for example). Put redo logs on a faster disk, or alternate redo logs on different physical disks, to reduce the archiving effect on LGWR. Don't use RAID 5, since it is very slow for applications that write a lot; potentially consider using file system direct I/O or raw devices, which are very fast at writing information.
  The associated event, log buffer parallel write is used by the redo log writer process, and it will indicate if your actual problem is with the log file I/O. Large wait times for this event can also be caused by having too few CPU resources available for the redolog writer process.

10. Idle Event. There are several idle wait events listed after the output; you can ignore them. Idle events are generally listed at the bottom of each section and include such things as SQL*Net message to/from client and other background-related timings. Idle events are listed in the stats$idle_event table.

11. global cache cr request: (OPS) This wait event shows the amount of time that an instance has waited for a requested data block for a consistent read and the transferred block has not yet arrived at the requesting instance. 
    See Note 157766.1 'Sessions Wait Forever for 'global cache cr request' Wait Event in OPS or RAC'. In some cases the 'global cache cr request' wait event may be perfectly normal if large buffer caches are used and the same data is being accessed concurrently on multiple instances. 
    In a perfectly tuned, non-OPS/RAC database, I/O wait events would be the top wait events but since we are avoiding I/O's with RAC and OPS the 'global cache cr request' wait event often takes the place of I/O wait events.

12. library cache pin: Library cache latch contention may be caused by not using bind variables. It is due to excessive parsing of sql statement.

13. CPU time: 
  This is not really a wait event (hence, the new name), but rather the sum of the CPU used by this session, or the amount of CPU time used during the snapshot window. In a heavily loaded system, if the CPU time event is the biggest event, that could point to some CPU-intensive processing (example, forcing the use of an index when a full scan should have been used), which could be the cause of the bottleneck. 
  When CPU Other is a significant component of total Response Time the next step is to find the SQL statements that access the most blocks. Block accesses are also known as Buffer Gets and Logical I/Os. Statspack lists such SQL statements in section SQL ordered by Gets. 

14. DB File Parallel Read:  This Wait Event is used when Oracle performs in parallel reads from multiple datafiles to non-contiguous buffers in memory (PGA or Buffer Cache). This is done during recovery operations or when buffer prefetching is being used as an optimization i.e. instead of performing multiple single-block reads.
    If this wait is an important component of Wait Time, follow the same guidelines as 'db file sequential read'. 

15. PX qref latch:  Can often mean that the "Producers are producing data quicker than the Consumers can consume it". Maybe we could increase parallel_execution_message_size to try to eliminate some of these waits or we might decrease the degree of parallelism. If the system workload is high consider to decrease the degree of parallelism. If you have DEFAULT parallelism on your object  you can decrease the value of PARALLEL_THREADS_PER_CPU.  Have in mind  DEFAULT degree = PARALLEL_THREADS_PER_CPU * #CPU's  

16. Log File Parallel Writes: Log file parallel write waits occur when waiting for writes of REDO records to the REDO log files to complete. The wait occurs in log writer (LGWR) as part of normal activity of copying records from the REDO log buffer to the current online log.
    The actual wait time is time taken for all outstanding I/O requests to complete. Even though the writes may be issued in parallel, LGWR needs to wait for the last I/O to be on disk before the parallel write is considered complete.
    Hence the wait time depends on the time it takes the OS to complete all requests. Waits for log file parallel writes can be identified by looking at the "Top 5 Timed Events" or "Wait Events" section of the Statspack report.
    Log file parallel write waits can be reduced by moving log files to the faster disks and/or separate disks where there will be less contention.

17. SQL*Net more data to client:
This means the instance is sending a lot of data to the client. You can decrease this time by having the client bring back less data. Maybe the application doesn't need to bring back as much data as it is. 

18. SQL*Net message to client:
The SQL*Net message to client Oracle metric indicates the server (foreground process) is sending a message to the client, and it can be used to identify throughput issues over a network, especially distributed databases with slow database links. 
The SQL*Net more data to client event happens when Oracle writes multiple data buffers (sized per SDU) in a single logical network call.

19. enq: TX - row lock contention:
    Oracle maintence data consistency with the help of locking mechanism. When a particular row is being modified by the process, either through Update/ Delete or Insert operation, oracle tries to acquire lock on that row. 
    Only when the process has acquired lock the process can modify the row otherwise the process waits for the lock. This wait situation triggers this event. The lock is released whenever a COMMIT is issued by the process which has acquired lock for the row. 
    Once the lock is released, processes waiting on this event can acquire lock on the row and perform DML operation


== 5.      Latch Waits 

So what exactly causes latch contention within Oracle? 
whenever a latch is busy and currently in use within Oracle, any process that requests access to the latch will spin before attempting to gain access to the latch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
If the latch is still unavailable, the process will keep spinning and using up valuable CPU resources, thus causing a performance problem.
Within Oracle, there is a hidden parameter called spin_count that sets the number of times that the process will spin in a loop before giving up and going to sleep.
What happens is that the initial sleep period is one centisecond on the first spin count ?. Each subsequent spin count is doubled until the spin_count threshold is reached, at which the process must relinquish CPU resources and sleep.
So, how does one identify latch contention issues within Oracle outside of using ADDM and AWR reports? Simple.

   Observations:
 This system is not generating a lot of redo (5K/s), with 1.33% of all blocks read being updated. (A)
 Comparing the number of Physical reads per second to the number of Physical writes per second shows the physical read to physical write ratio is high enough(10:1)  (B). Typical OLTP systems have a read-to-write ratio of 10:1 or 5:1 - 
 This system is not that busy, with 593 User calls per second.(C)
 The total parse rate (Parses per second) seems not to be high (D), with the Hard parse rate very low, which implies the majority of the parses are soft parses (D). 
The high parse rate may tie in with the latch free event, if the latch contended for is the library cache latch, however no assumptions should be made. (D)
 
 ** Where:
. Redo size:  This is the amount of redo generated during this report. If you see an increase here then more DML statements are taking place (meaning your users are doing more INSERTs, UPDATEs, and DELETEs than before
. Logical Reads: This is calculated as Consistent Gets + DB Block Gets =  Logical Reads
. Block changes: The number of blocks modified during the sample interval. If you see an increase here then more DML statements are taking place (meaning your users are doing more INSERTs, UPDATEs, and DELETEs than before
. Physical Reads: The number of requests for a block that caused a physical I/O.
. Physical Writes: The number of physical writes issued.
. User Calls: The number of queries generated
. Parses: Total of all parses: both hard and soft
. Hard Parses: Those parses requiring a completely new parse of the SQL statement.  A hard parse rate of greater than 100 per second indicates there is a very high amount of hard parsing on the system. High hard parse rates cause serious performance issues, and must be investigated. A high hard parse rate is usually accompanied by latch contention on the shared pool and library cache latches. Check whether waits for latch free appear in the top-5 wait events, and if so, examine the latching sections of the Statspack report. Of course, we want a low number here.
. Soft Parses: Not listed but derived by subtracting the hard parses from parses.  A soft parse reuses a previous hard parse and hence consumes far fewer resources. A high soft parse rate could be anywhere in the rate of 300 or more per second. Unnecessary soft parses also limit application scalability; optimally a SQL statement should be soft-parsed once per session, and executed many times.
. Sorts and Logons are all self explanatory
. Executes: how many statements we are executing per second / transaction
. Transactions: how many transactions per second we process 

This gives an overall view of the load on the server. In this case, we are looking at a very good hard parse number and a fairly high system load.              
The per-second statistics show you the changes in throughput (i.e. whether the instance is performing more work per second). For example:
 a significant increase in redo size, block changes and pct of blocks changed per read would indicate the instance is performing more inserts/updates/deletes.
 an increase in the redo size without an increase in the number of transactions per second would indicate a changing transaction profile.
Similarly, looking at the per-transaction statistics allows you to identify changes in the application characteristics by comparing these to the corresponding statistics from the baseline report.

Observations:
 The 100% soft parse ratio (A) indicates the system is not hard-parsing. However the system is soft parsing a lot, rather than only re-binding and re-executing the same cursors, as the Execute to Parse % is very low (A).
 Also, the CPU time used for parsing (A) is only 58% of the total elapsed parse time (see Parse CPU to Parse Elapsd). This may also imply some resource contention during parsing (possibly related to the latch free event?).
 There seems to be a lot of unused memory in the shared pool (only 29% is used) (B). If there is insufficient memory allocated to other areas of the database (or OS), this memory could be redeployed

- - 
Buffer Nowait Ratio: This is the percentage of time that the instance made a call to get a buffer (all buffer types are included here) and that buffer was made available immediately (meaning it didn't have to wait for the buffer...hence "Buffer Nowait"). If the ratio is low, then could be a (hot) block(s) being contended for that should be found in the Buffer Wait Section.. If the ratio is low, check the Buffer Wait Statistics section of the report for more detail on which type of block is being contended for.
Buffer Hit Ratio   : (also known as the buffer-cache hit ratio) Ideally more than 95 percent. It shows the % of times a particular block was found in buffer cache insted of performing a physical I/O (reading from disk). 
Although historically known as one of the most important statistics to evaluate, this ratio can sometimes be misleading. A low buffer hit ratio does not necessarily mean the cache is too small; it may be that potentially valid full-table scans are artificially reducing what is otherwise a good ratio. Similarly, a high buffer hit ratio (say, 99 percent) normally indicates that the cache is adequately sized, but this assumption may not always be valid. For example, frequently executed SQL statements that repeatedly refer to a small number of buffers via indexed lookups can create a misleadingly high buffer hit ratio. When these buffers are read, they are placed at the most recently used (MRU) end of the buffer cache; iterative access to these buffers can artificially inflate the buffer hit ratio. This inflation makes tuning the buffer cache a challenge. Sometimes you can identify a too-small buffer cache by the appearance of the write complete waits event, which indicates that hot blocks (that is, blocks that are still being modified) are aging out of the cache while they are still needed; check the Wait Events list for evidence of this event.
Library Hit Ratio  : This ratio, also known as the library-cache hit ratio, gives the percentage of pin requests that result in pin hits. A pin hit occurs when the SQL or PL/SQL code to be executed is already in the library cache and is valid to execute. If the "Library Hit ratio" is low, it could be indicative of a shared pool that is too small (SQL is prematurely pushed out of the shared pool), or just as likely, that the system did not make correct use of bind variables in the application. If the soft parse ratio is also low, check whether there's a parsing issue. A lower ratio could also indicate that bind variables are not used or some other issue is causing SQL not to be reused (in which case a smaller shared pool may only be a band-aid that will potentially fix a library latch problem which may result). 
Execute to Parse   : If value is negative, it means that the number of parses is larger than the number of executions. Another cause for a negative execute to parse ratio is if the shared pool is too small and queries are aging out of the shared pool and need to be reparsed.  This is another form of thrashing which also degrades performance tremendously. So, if you run some SQL and it has to be parsed every time you execute it (because no plan exists for this statement) then your percentage would be 0%. The more times that your SQL statement can reuse an existing plan the higher your Execute to Parse ratio is. This is very BAD!! One way to increase your parse ratio is to use bind variables. 
Parse CPU to Parse Elapsd %: Generally, this is a measure of how available your CPU cycles were for SQL parsing. If this is low, you may see "latch free" as one of your top wait events.
Redo Nowait Ratio  : This ratio indicates the amount of redo entries generated for which there was space available in the redo log. The instance didn't have to wait to use the redo log if this is 100%
The redo-log space-request statistic is incremented when an Oracle process attempts to write a redo-log entry but there is not sufficient space remaining in the online redo log. Thus, a value close to 100 percent for the redo nowait ratio indicates minimal time spent waiting for redo logs to become available, either because the logs are not filling up very often or because the database is able to switch to a new log quickly whenever the current log fills up.
If your alert log shows that you are switching logs frequently (that is, more than once every 15 minutes), you may be able to reduce the amount of switching by increasing the size of the online redo logs. If the log switches are not frequent, check the disks on which the redo logs reside to see why the switches are not happening quickly. If these disks are not overloaded, they may be slow, which means you could put the files on faster disks.
In-Memory Sort Ratio: This ratio gives the percentage of sorts that were performed in memory, rather than requiring a disk-sort segment to complete the sort. Optimally, in an OLTP environment, this ratio should be high. Setting the PGA_AGGREGATE_TARGET (or SORT_AREA_SIZE) initialization parameter effectively will eliminate this problem, as a minimum you pretend to have this one in 95%
Soft Parse Ratio   : This ratio gives the percentage of parses that were soft, as opposed to hard. A soft parse occurs when a session attempts to execute a SQL statement and a usable version of the statement is already in the shared pool. In other words, all data (such as the optimizer execution plan) pertaining to the statement in the shared pool is equally applicable to the statement currently being issued. A hard parse, on the other hand, occurs when the current SQL statement is either not in the shared pool or not there in a shareable form. An example of the latter case would be when the SQL statement in the shared pool is textually identical to the current statement but the tables referred to in the two statements resolve to physically different tables.
Hard parsing is an expensive operation and should be kept to a minimum in an OLTP environment. The aim is to parse once, execute many times.
Ideally, the soft parse ratio should be greater than 95 percent. When the soft parse ratio falls much below 80 percent, investigate whether you can share SQL by using bind variables or force cursor sharing by using the init.ora parameter cursor_sharing.
Before you jump to any conclusions about your soft parse ratio, however, be sure to compare it against the actual hard and soft parse rates shown in the Load Profile. If the rates are low (for example, 1 parse per second), parsing may not be a significant issue in your system. Another useful standard of comparison is the proportion of parse time that was not CPU-related, given by the following ratio:
(parse time CPU) / (parse time elapsed)

A low value for this ratio could mean that the non-CPU-related parse time was spent waiting for latches, which might indicate a parsing or latching problem. To investigate further, look at the shared-pool and library-cache latches in the Latch sections of the report for indications of contention on these latches.
Latch Hit Ratio: This is the ratio of the total number of latch misses to the number of latch gets for all latches. A low value for this ratio indicates a latching problem, whereas a high value is generally good. However, as the data is rolled up over all latches, a high latch hit ratio can artificially mask a low get rate on a specific latch. Cross-check this value with the Top 5 Wait Events to see if latch free is in the list, and refer to the Latch sections of the report. Latch Hit % of less than 99 percent is usually a big problem. 

Also check the "Shared Pool Statistics", if the "End" value is in the high 95%-100% range ,this is a indication that the shared pool needs to be increased (especially if the "Begin" value is much smaller) 
% SQL with executions>1: Shows % of SQLs executed more than 1 time. The % should be very near to value 100.
% memory for SQL w/exec>1: From the memory space allocated to cursors, shows which % has been used by cursors more than 1.
