There are several approaches you can follow:
- Export / Import to include the use of Datapump facilities. 
- Transportable Tablespaces 10G or Later.
- RMAN Convert Database functions. 10G or Later.
- Streams Replication.
- Create Table As Select (CTAS).
- Dataguard Heterogeneous Primary and Physical Standbys.
- Oracle Golden Gate. 

There is nothing like best method. There are just different methods, each with its own pros and cons. 

The choice will depend upon 
- your size of database
- how much downtime you can afford
- do you need new features like ASMM or AMM etc
- is your db moving to new server

Pros and Cons

- Using Transportable Tablespaces: Enables a full set of tablespaces to be moved. Fastest approach.
- Using Pulling Tablespaces: Combines all steps in the transportable tablespaces approach into a single step.                    However, Less flexibility - multiple files transferred sequentially.
- ASM (will need RMAN to pull out tablespaces into file structures)
- Export/ EXPDP is slower compared to TTS
- For the online change synchronization you could use the GoldenGate

Following document might be of your interest:

Note 733205.1 Migration of an Oracle Database Across OS Platforms 
Note 1152016.1 Master Note For Oracle Database Upgrades and Migrations

Inside this document, you will find many other documents depending upon the method you are going to follow,
be it RMAN, export/import, Transportable tablespace etc.

If you want to use GoldenGate for migration, you should go throug following white paper.
