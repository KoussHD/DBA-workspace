How do I log into EM Express?

A user can log into EM Express by using a browser and opening the URL to https://<hostname>:<port>/em.  A login page will be displayed, and the user can log in with any valid DB credential.

How can I find the port on which EM Express is configured?
When dbca completes, it indicates the port on which EM Express is configured.  If that information is no longer available, there are two ways to find the HTTP/HTTPS port for EM Express:
> lsnrctl status | grep HTTP
  (DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=tcps)(HOST=xxx.us.oracle.com)(PORT=5500))(Security=(my_wallet_directory=/u01/oracle/app/oracle/admin/orcl/xdb_wallet))(Presentation=HTTP)(Session=RAW))

or from SQL*Plus:
SQL> select dbms_xdb.getHttpPort() from dual;

GETHTTPPORT
-----------
       8080

SQL> select dbms_xdb_config.getHttpsPort() from dual;

GETHTTPSPORT
------------
        5500
        
-How do I set up EM Express?
-----------------------------
DBCA allows you to set up EM Express at the time of database creation.

If you want to manually set up EM Express, simply configure the HTTPS or HTTP port by logging into the database and setting the port:
SQL> exec dbms_xdb_config.sethttpsport(5500);

or

SQL> exec dbms_xdb_config.sethttpport(8080);
If you are using a listener TCP port other than 1521, you will also need to set the dispatchers and local_listener initialization parameters.  Please see the documentation for further information.


Do I need licenses or packs to use EM Express?
-----------------------------------------------
You can use the basic administration features offered by EM Express with no additional licenses.  However, to use the performance features, you will need the Oracle Diagnostics Pack.  For the Performance Hub, you will need the Diagnostics Pack and for the SQL Monitor and SQL Tuning Advisor features, you will need the Tuning Pack.

Depending on what packs you own, you should set the control_management_pack_access init.ora parameter on your system.  For example, if you have the Diagnostics Pack, but not the Tuning Pack, you should set the control_management_pack_access parameter=DIAGNOSTIC.
