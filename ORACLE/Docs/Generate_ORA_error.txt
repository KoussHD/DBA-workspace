- For version 10g (and most likely 9i):
exec sys.dbms_system.ksdwrt(2, 'ORA-07445: SIMULATED ERROR, JUST FOR TESTING, IGNORE!!!');
If you would like to add the error to the alertlog and generate an tracefile for it, use:
exec sys.dbms_system.ksdwrt(3, 'ORA-07445: SIMULATED ERROR, JUST FOR TESTING, IGNORE!!!');

- For version 11g (and above):

alter session set events '942 incident(SIMULATED_ERROR)';
drop table tablethatdoesnotexist;
alter session set events '942 trace name context off';
